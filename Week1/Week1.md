AI Awareness Reflection

AI Tool Explored: ChatGPT Edu

How it helped:
It helped me understand each setup step clearly. When I wasn’t sure how to verify Python or how GitHub Classroom worked, ChatGPT explained the steps in a simple way so I didn’t get stuck.

How it confused me:
Sometimes AI gives extra steps or info I don’t actually need, so I had to focus on just the required instructions.

How I will verify AI suggestions:

I will test the commands myself in VS Code.

I will check official Python or GitHub documentation if something seems unclear.

I won’t copy code without running it to make sure it actually works.
